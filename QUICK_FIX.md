# Quick Fix for App Issues

## The Problem
The app is having connection issues between your computer and phone. This is common and has several solutions.

## Solution 1: Use Tunnel Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop everything first
pkill -f expo
pkill -f metro

# Start with tunnel (creates public URL)
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**What this does**: Creates a public URL that works from anywhere, bypassing network issues.

## Solution 2: Use Web Version (Easiest)
```bash
# Open in your browser
npx expo start --web
```
Then open http://localhost:19006 in your browser.

## Solution 3: Test the Simple App
I've created a simple test version. Try this:

1. **Open the test file**: Open `test.html` in your browser
2. **If that works**: The basic setup is correct
3. **Then try**: `npx expo start --tunnel`

## Solution 4: Network Troubleshooting

### Check if your phone and computer are on the same WiFi:
1. **Phone**: Settings → WiFi → Check network name
2. **Computer**: Check WiFi network name
3. **Must match**: Both devices on same network

### Try different networks:
1. **Mobile hotspot**: Use your phone's hotspot
2. **Different WiFi**: Try a different network
3. **Corporate networks**: Often block connections

## Solution 5: Expo Go App Issues

### Update Expo Go:
1. **App Store**: Search "Expo Go"
2. **Update**: Make sure you have the latest version
3. **Restart**: Close and reopen the app

### Clear Expo Go cache:
1. **Settings**: In Expo Go app
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear all cached data
3. **Restart**: Close and reopen

## What to Try Right Now

### Step 1: Test Basic Setup
```bash
# Open this file in your browser
open test.html
```

### Step 2: Try Tunnel Mode
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

### Step 3: Check Your Network
- Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi
- Try using your phone's hotspot
- Check if you're on a corporate/restricted network

## Still Not Working?

The issue is likely one of these:
1. **Network restrictions** - Corporate WiFi blocking connections
2. **Firewall** - Computer blocking incoming connections
3. **Expo Go version** - Outdated app
4. **Network mismatch** - Phone and computer on different networks

**Try the web version first** - it's the most reliable way to test the app.

## Quick Test
1. **Open**: `test.html` in your browser
2. **If that works**: Your setup is correct
3. **Then try**: Tunnel mode for mobile testing
