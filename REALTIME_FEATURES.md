# Real-Time Features Implementation

## Overview
The bet platform now includes real-time functionality that automatically updates the UI when any user makes changes, without requiring manual refresh.

## How It Works

### Real-Time Subscriptions
The app uses Supabase's real-time capabilities to listen for database changes:

1. **Active Bets (Home Screen)**: Listens for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on bets with `status = 'active'`
2. **Concluded Bets (History Screen)**: Listens for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on bets with `status = 'concluded'`

### Implementation Details

#### Real-Time Service (`lib/realtime.ts`)
- `subscribeToActiveBets()`: Subscribes to changes in active bets
- `subscribeToConcludedBets()`: Subscribes to changes in concluded bets
- `subscribeToBets()`: General subscription for all bet changes

#### Home Screen (`app/tabs/index.tsx`)
- Automatically receives new bets when created by partner
- Updates bet list when bets are modified
- Removes bets when deleted by partner
- Re-establishes subscription when screen comes into focus

#### History Screen (`app/tabs/history.tsx`)
- Automatically receives newly concluded bets
- Updates bet details when bets are modified
- Removes bets when deleted
- Re-establishes subscription when screen comes into focus

### Real-Time Events Handled

1. **New Bet Created**: When partner creates a bet, it immediately appears on your home screen
2. **Bet Concluded**: When partner concludes a bet, it immediately appears in your history
3. **Bet Deleted**: When partner deletes a bet, it immediately disappears from your screen
4. **Bet Updated**: Any modifications to bets are immediately reflected

### Technical Features

- **Automatic Reconnection**: Subscriptions are re-established when screens come into focus
- **Memory Management**: Subscriptions are properly cleaned up when components unmount
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Performance**: Only subscribes to relevant data (filtered by couple_id and status)

### User Experience

- **No Manual Refresh**: Users never need to pull-to-refresh or navigate away and back
- **Instant Updates**: Changes appear immediately (typically within 1-2 seconds)
- **Seamless Experience**: Works across all screens and navigation
- **Reliable**: Handles network issues and reconnects automatically

## Testing Real-Time Features

1. **Open the app on two devices/browsers**
2. **Create a bet on one device** - it should appear immediately on the other
3. **Conclude a bet on one device** - it should move to history on both devices
4. **Delete a bet on one device** - it should disappear from both devices

## Console Logs

The real-time functionality includes detailed logging:
- `üîî` - Real-time events received
- `‚úÖ` - Successful subscription setup
- `‚ùå` - Errors or connection issues
- `üîï` - Subscription cleanup

## Dependencies

- `@supabase/supabase-js` (v2.75.0) - Provides real-time capabilities
- Supabase database with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
