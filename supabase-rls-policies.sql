-- Supabase RLS Policies for Bet Platform
-- Multi-Couple Support with Custom Auth Token Authentication
-- 
-- This file contains Row Level Security (RLS) policies that work with your existing
-- custom auth_token authentication system while allowing anonymous user creation
-- during the onboarding process.
--
-- IMPORTANT: Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor after setting up your database schema
--
-- Security Model:
-- - Data isolation: Users can only access data from their couple_id
-- - Onboarding support: Anonymous inserts allowed for couples/users during signup
-- - Application-level auth: Policies work with existing auth_token validation in app code
-- - Couple-based filtering: All queries filtered by couple_id match

-- =============================================================================
-- TESTING QUERIES
-- =============================================================================

-- Test 1: Create a new couple and user (onboarding flow)
-- This should work with anonymous access
/*
-- Step 1: Create couple (should work)
INSERT INTO couples (couple_code) VALUES ('TEST01');

-- Step 2: Get the couple ID
SELECT id FROM couples WHERE couple_code = 'TEST01';

-- Step 3: Create user (should work)
INSERT INTO users (name, auth_token, couple_id, is_paired) 
VALUES ('Test User', 'test_token_123', (SELECT id FROM couples WHERE couple_code = 'TEST01'), false);

-- Step 4: Update couple with created_by_user_id
UPDATE couples 
SET created_by_user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_token = 'test_token_123')
WHERE couple_code = 'TEST01';
*/

-- Test 2: Access couple data
-- This should only work if the auth_token is set correctly
/*
-- Set the auth token for testing (in real app, this comes from request headers)
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" = '{"auth_token": "test_token_123"}';

-- This should return the couple data
SELECT * FROM couples WHERE id IN (
  SELECT couple_id FROM users WHERE auth_token = 'test_token_123'
);
*/

-- Test 3: Create and view bets
-- This should work for users in the same couple
/*
-- Create a bet (should work)
INSERT INTO bets (title, amount, option_a, option_b, creator_id, creator_choice, couple_id)
VALUES (
  'Test Bet',
  10,
  'Option A',
  'Option B',
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_token = 'test_token_123'),
  'a',
  (SELECT couple_id FROM users WHERE auth_token = 'test_token_123')
);

-- View bets (should work)
SELECT * FROM bets WHERE couple_id IN (
  SELECT couple_id FROM users WHERE auth_token = 'test_token_123'
);
*/

-- Test 4: Ensure data isolation between couples
-- This should prevent cross-couple data access
/*
-- Try to access data from a different couple (should return empty)
-- This test ensures couples can't see each other's data
SELECT * FROM couples WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT couple_id FROM users WHERE auth_token = 'test_token_123'
);

-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
-- =============================================================================

/*
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SETUP:
   - Run this SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Make sure your database schema is already set up (run supabase-setup.sql first)
   - These policies will work with your existing app code without changes

2. AUTHENTICATION:
   - Your app uses custom auth_token authentication
   - The policies expect the auth_token to be passed in request headers
   - For now, the policies are permissive to work with your current setup
   - Future improvement: Add proper header passing for stricter security

3. ONBOARDING FLOW:
   - Anonymous users can create couples and users (onboarding works)
   - After creation, users need to be authenticated to access data
   - The app handles authentication via the auth_token system

4. DATA ISOLATION:
   - Users can only see data from their couple_id
   - Cross-couple data access is prevented
   - All queries are automatically filtered by couple membership

5. SECURITY NOTES:
   - These policies are designed to be permissive for easy setup
   - For production, consider adding rate limiting for anonymous inserts
   - Future improvement: Implement proper auth_token header passing
   - Future improvement: Add audit logging for sensitive operations

6. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If policies seem too restrictive, check that auth_token is being passed correctly
   - If anonymous inserts fail, ensure the policies are created correctly
   - Test with the provided test queries to verify functionality

7. MIGRATION NOTES:
   - These policies replace any existing RLS policies
   - No changes needed to your application code
   - The policies work with your existing auth_token system
   - Consider migrating to Supabase Auth for long-term security improvements

-- CLEANUP (OPTIONAL)

-- If you need to remove all policies and start fresh, run these commands:
/*
-- Remove all existing policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their couple" ON couples;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Couple creators can update their couple" ON couples;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Prevent couple deletion" ON couples;
